# Covid-vaccine-flask-project

Project Description:
The COVID Vaccination Details Storage project aims to create a Python application using SQLite3 and Flask frame work to store and retrieve user information related to COVID-19 vaccination.
The application provides a user interface where users can enter their Aadhaar details, name, age, and other relevant information. This data is then stored in a SQLite database. 
Additionally, the application includes a separate page where users can access their stored details by entering the correct credentials.

Python Flask Application Overview:

User Registration:

The application provides a user interface where users can enter their Aadhaar details, name, age, and other required information.
When the user submits the form, the entered data is validated, and if valid, it is stored in the SQLite database.
User Authentication:

The application includes a separate login page where users can enter their credentials (e.g., Aadhaar details) to access their stored details.
The entered credentials are validated against the data stored in the database, and if they match, the user is granted access.
Database Storage:

The application utilizes SQLite3 to create a database for storing user information.
The database schema should include tables to store the relevant details, such as Aadhaar number, name, age, and other necessary fields.
User Details Retrieval:

Once a user successfully logs in, they are redirected to a page where their stored details are displayed.
The application retrieves the relevant information from the database based on the user's credentials.

This project is implemeted with the basic knowlegde of Python, SQLite3, and Flask framework. Also HTML and CSS and Boostrap to design the user interface for registration and login pages.
