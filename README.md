Project Overview:

The COVID vaccination details storage system is a basic web-based application that allows users to store and manage vaccination data. It will have a user-friendly interface for entering and retrieving vaccination details, and the data will be stored in a backend database.

Backend:
Language: Python, 
Framework: Flask (a lightweight web framework for Python), 
Database: SQLite (a simple file-based database for development)

Frontend:
HTML: Markup language for structuring the content of the web pages, 
CSS: Styling language for defining the presentation of the web pages, 
Bootstrap: Frontend framework for responsive.

Project Features:

Vaccination Data Entry: Allows users to enter vaccination details, including name, Aadhar number, age and no of Vaccine doses taken.
Vaccination Data Retrieval: Enable users to search and retrieve vaccination details based on Aadhar number.
If entered number is validated against the data stored in the database, and if they match, the user details will be displayed.

Data Validation: Implement necessary validation checks on the user input to ensure integrity of the stored data.
Responsive Design: Ensure that the frontend is mobile-friendly and accessible across different devices and screen sizes.
Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to provide error messages to users when encountering issues.
